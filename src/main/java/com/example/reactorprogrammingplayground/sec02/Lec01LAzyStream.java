        //Stream.of(1)
        //.peek(i -> log.info("Received: " + i)); // This code will not run
        //Why won't it run?
        //Because there is no Terminal Operator (like forEach, collect, toArray).
        //A stream does nothing without a terminal operation.
        //peek() executes a side-effect for each item passed through the stream (like System.out.println() or log.info()).
        //But the important thing is that it does not execute the stream by itself. It only executes when a terminal operation (like collect(), forEach(), or count()) is attached to it.
        //
        //If we write it like this:
        //Stream.of(1)
        //.peek(i -> log.info("Received: " + i))
        //.collect(Collectors.toList());
        //Now the output is printed because .collect() is a terminal operator and "consumes" the stream.
        //Streams in Java and Publishers in Reactive Streams (like Mono and Flux) do not run without a subscriber.
        //Reactive Streams â‰ˆ Lazy Java Streams + Asynchronous + Backpressure
